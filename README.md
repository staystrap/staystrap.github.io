## Contributing
Tips for every city are contained in their own repository.
E.g. the tips for Brisbane in Australia can be found in [this repository](http://github.com/staystrap/brisbane).

Now, do you want to pass on your knowledge about a city that is not yet covered?

## Working on existing content
Fork the repository, make your changes and create a pull request.
To create a new page, e.g. for sport activities or sights, simply create a file
like `activities.md` in the root of the repository. Be sure to include the
markup at the beginning of the file:

```
---
layout: article
image: page_cover_image.jpg
title: Activities
---
```

The name of the file determines the sort order, which is the reason why some
files are prefixed with a letter and an underscore.

## Give tips for a new city
Fork the template repository and change the file `_config.yaml` to reflect
the appropriate city name. Please also adapt the color scheme to something sensible
so that some distinction is visible to other cities.

# This is too complicated!
This system is not the best solution for this - albeit the cheapest and fastest,
non-CS students will probably not know how to use this. But do not give up, we still need your help!
If you can't be bothered with this, just drop us your structured input
and we will be happy to do the lifting ourselves: [felix.wolff2@student.hpi.de](mailto:felix.wolff2@student.hpi.de)
